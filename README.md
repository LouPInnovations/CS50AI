# CS50AI
My projects from Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

****IMPORTANT****:
These projects are listed on my github with the intention of recording my progress, learning, and understanding from this course, 
and by NO MEANS should anything from these be used in your project for the same course (mainly directed to those who are doing this course for a certification). If you are taking this course, I kindly advise that you do not look further into this repository.

Projects are done with templates (if given) from Harvard and I have filled in the missing code to implement the knowledge
that I have learned from this course.

The code I implemented is documented with internal comments (Original comments are left alone).

The .py files for each project will be included (as I did this in PyCharm, which has a bunch of other directories/files
within this project that is not 100% required for function)
