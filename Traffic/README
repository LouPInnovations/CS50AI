For this to work, you would need to get and unzip the gtsrb from the website.

I do not know why the program did not run through command line (had an issue with ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2')
so I ended up modifying other parts of the script so it would have the same functionality.
(I ended up moving everything that would be done into the script, so it could be ran directly from PyCharm)

The accuracy could be better with some tweaking, but I know the concepts and what should be done so I decided to move on for now.
